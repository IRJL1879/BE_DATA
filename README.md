Repository contains the following files:
(1) A compressed (zipped) csv file (39410_CSVData.zip) with full data extract of all rows 
(2) An Excel file (Data information.xlsx) containing relevant numbers for extract from Spreadsheet data
(3) A Jupyter notebook (39410_XLS_to_CSV_conversion.ipynb) with code/comments used to convert XLS to CSV 
(4) A Jupyter notebook (BE_DATA_load_from_csv_file.ipynb) with loader code to 'check' the CSV to Dataframe success:
Note that the file (29410_Data_worksheets.xlsx) used for the process is too large for the git repository even when compressed!
